### About

The following is a selection of my projects and homeworks from my introduction to the World Wide Web course. Compared to a lot of the work that I did in my other computer science courses, these projects are incredibly basic. I mainly put these up here to showcase my understanding of web design principles. As such, if you navigate to the [github pages for this repo](https://sinkingrowboats.github.io/intro_to_www_projects) you will see a list of links to some the individual projects. I've only chosen a slection of projects and homeworks as some of the projects had incredibly simple UIs or were entirely simple javascript and therefore of little use for showcasing my web development skills. The projects are all coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In the course I also learned PHP, which was used to implement the final project. However, since I'm hosting the pages through an extremely basic github pages set up, the final project is entirely static and mainly serves so showcase the design. Hopefully I'll get off my ass one of these days and add a how to run section for the final project, but probably not, especially considering the fact that the server the data posts to is one that I don't think my professor has used in a hot second.

### A Note about that Final Project

The intent of this project was to create a mock webpage for the "Chicago Shakespeare Repertory Theater", showcasing the upcoming Tragedies, Comedies, and Histories. Clicking on the Name of the play will cause the description of the play to be displayed, and will toggle between the two descriptions as chosen. At the bottom there is a form to purchase the tickets. This is where the actual PHP came into play, but since that's not easily hosted on github pages and the purpose of adding these projects was more to demonstrate familiarity with web design, the form doesn't do anything.
