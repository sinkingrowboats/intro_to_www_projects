# Intro to the World Wide Web Projects

### This is a work in Progress

This is supposed to be the code from my Intro to the World Wide Web course. I mainly put these up here to showcase my understanding of web design principles. As such, if you navigate to the [github pages for this repo](https://sinkingrowboats.github.io/intro_to_www_projects). You will see a list (okay right now it's just one item), you will see a list of links to the individual projects. The projects are all the static webpages with their HTML, CSS, and Javascript files.

### A Note about that Final Project

The intent of this project was to create a mock webpage for the "Chicago Shakespeare Repertory Theater", showcasing the upcoming Tragedies, Comedies, and Histories. Clicking on the Name of the play will cause the description of the play to be displayed, and will toggle between the two descriptions as chosen. At the bottom there is a form to purchase the tickets. This is where the actual PHP came into play, but since that's not easily hosted on github pages and the purpose of adding these projects was more to demonstrate familiarity with web design, the form doesn't do anything.
